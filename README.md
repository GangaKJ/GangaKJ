- ⚡ The First Bug: The term "bug" in the context of computer programming was originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper,
      a computer scientist, found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer.
      She removed the moth and taped it to the computer's logbook, coining the term "debugging".
